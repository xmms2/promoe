Required dependencies:
	* QT4.2.x           http://www.trolltech.no/
	* XMMS2             http://xmms2.xmms.org/
	* XMMS2 C++ bindings (make sure you have boost_signals when compiling xmms2)
	  - promoe works with 0.4DrK and 0.5DrL
	* Python for compiling

Optional dependencys:
	* Avahi     http://www.avahi.org/

Compiling:
	1) Run './waf configure' 
	2) Run './waf build'
	     This can take some time
	3) Run './waf install' to install
	4) Have fun

	To change the install directory, use 
	   './waf configure --prefix=<path>' at step 1

Reporting Bugs:
	preferred way to report bugs is through xmms2's bugtracker at
	'http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se/' at project 'Client - Promoe'

Patches:
	Best practice to submit a path is through the bugtracker at
	'http://bugs.xmms2.xmms.se/' at project 'Client - Promoe'.

	Either append the patch to the bug it fixes or supply a link to your own
	git repository (github.com is a good place for your own public git
	repository)

	To discuss a patch or feature request, you can also try to reach the
	developer at xmms2's irc channel #xmms2 on freenode (irc.freenode.net)

Configuration:
	Config file defaults to ~/.config/xmms2/Promoe.conf

	To change the playlist text style, add these default values to the
	[playlist] section then change as desired: (see below for the old ones)

	format_l_normal=%#2ca4c7%@. <r>%r - </r>%#------%t %#444444 %c
	format_r_normal=<l>%#12576b<n>%n:</n>%l %#------</l>%d
	format_l_normal_selected=%#2ca4c7%@. <r>%r - </r>%#------%t %#444444 %c
	format_r_normal_selected=<l>%#003342<n>%n:</n>%l %#------</l>%d
	format_l_active=%@. <r>%r - </r>%t %#555555 %c
	format_r_active=<l><n>%n:</n>%l </l>%d
	format_l_active_selected=%@. <r>%r - </r>%t %#555555 %c
	format_r_active_selected=<l><n>%n:</n>%l </l>%d

	For each playlist row, the above items mean:
		*_l_*       Left-justified text
		*_r_*       Right-justified text
		*_normal    Default style (used for most playlist entries)
		*_active    The one currently playing entry
		*_selected  As above but also has been clicked on to select it

		By default, the active one makes most of the text white, and the
		selected one tweaks the brightness a little to give better
		contrast against the selection background colour.

	Placeholders:
		%@  Playlist index
		%c  Play count (number of times track has been played)
		%d  Duration
		%l  Album
		%n  Track number
		%r  Artist
		%t  Title
		%#  Change colour - HTML RGB codes, exactly 6 chars must follow
		    %#ff0000  bright red
		    %#------  current skin's default text colour
		    %#++++++  skin's default "bright" text colour
		<X></X>  Hide text between the tags if tag "X" is blank, e.g.
		         <l>%n %l</l> will only show tracknum+album if album is
		         present

	To change the selection background colour, add this item to [playlist]:

		format_clr_sel_bg=#FF0000

	To return to the default skin-specified colour, delete this line again.

	To go back to the simpler style used in earlier Promoe versions, use:

		format_l_normal=%@. <r>%r - </r>%t
		format_r_normal=%d
		format_l_normal_selected=%@. <r>%r - </r>%t
		format_r_normal_selected=%d
		format_l_active=%@. <r>%r - </r>%t
		format_r_active=%d
		format_l_active_selected=%@. <r>%r - </r>%t
		format_r_active_selected=%d
